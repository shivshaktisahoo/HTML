        <b>The Great Wall of China</b> is an ancient wall in China. The wall is made of cement, rocks, bricks, and dirt. It was finished in 1878 and it was meant to protect the north of the empire of China from enemy attacks. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, 9.1 metres (30 feet) wide and 15 metres high. The earlier sections on the wall are made of compacted dirt and stone. Later in the Ming Dynasty they used bricks. There are 7,000 watch towers, block houses for soldiers and beacons to send smoke signals.<br>
        Nineteen walls have been built that were called the Great Wall of China. The first was built in the 7th century BC.<a href="#note1"> <sup>[1]</sup></a> The most famous wall was built between 226–250 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Hong (Qin Pronounced as Chin) , during the Qin Dynasty. Not much of this wall remains as people have been stealing from it. It was much farther north than the current wall. The current wall was built during the Ming Dynasty.

            The collection of fortifications known as the Great Wall of China has historically had a number of different names in both Chinese and English.<br><br>
            In Chinese histories, the term "Long Wall(s)" (t 長城, s 长城, Chángchéng) appears in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, where it referred both to the separate great walls built between and north of the Warring States and to the more unified construction of the First Emperor.The Chinese character 城, meaning city or fortress, is a phono-semantic compound of the "earth" radical 土 and phonetic 成, whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as *deŋ. It originally referred to the rampart which surrounded traditional Chinese cities and was used by extension for these walls around their respective states; today, however, it is much more often the Chinese word for "city".<br>
            The longer Chinese name "Ten-Thousand Mile Long Wall" (t 萬里長城, s 万里长城, Wànlǐ Chángchéng) came from Sima Qian's description of it in the Records, though he did not name the walls as such. The AD 493 Book of Song quotes the frontier general Tan Daoji referring to "the long wall of 10,000 miles", closer to the modern name, but the name rarely features in pre-modern times otherwise. The traditional Chinese mile (里, lǐ) was an often irregular distance that was intended to show the length of a standard village and varied with terrain but was usually standardized at distances around a third of an English mile (540 m). Since China's metrication in 1930, it has been exactly equivalent to 500 metres or 1,600 feet, which would make the wall's name describe a distance of 5,000 km (3,100 mi). However, this use of "ten-thousand" (wàn) is figurative in a similar manner to the Greek and English myriad and simply means "innumerable" or "immeasurable".<a href="#note2"> <sup>[2]</sup></a><br><br>
            The current English name evolved from accounts of "the Chinese wall" from early modern European travelers. By the nineteenth century, "The Great Wall of China" had become standard in English and French, although other European languages such as German continue to refer to it as "the Chinese wall".

        The Great Wall of the Qin stretches from Lintao to Liaodong
        The Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall-building by the time of       the Spring and Autumn period between the 8th and 5th centuries BC. During this time and     the subsequent Warring States period, the states of Qin, Wei, Zhao, Qi, Han, Yan, and         Zhongshan all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders. Built to        withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made     mostly of stone or by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.<br>


        The Great Wall of the Han is the longest of all walls, from Mamitu near Yumenguan to        Liaodong
        King Zheng of Qin conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the First        Emperor of the Qin dynasty ("Qin Shi Huang") in 221 BC. Intending to impose centralized     rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the       sections of the walls that divided his empire among the former states. To position the    empire against the Xiongnu people from the north, however, he ordered the building of     new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire's northern frontier.      "Build and move on" was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall, implying        that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border. Transporting the large      quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried    to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while      rammed earth was used for construction in the plains. <br>There are no surviving historical    records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls. Most of the ancient     walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today. The human       cost of the construction is unknown, but it has been estimated by some authors that       hundreds of thousands workers died building the Qin wall. Later, the Han, the Northern    Dynasties and the Sui all repaired, rebuilt, or expanded sections of the Great Wall at    great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders. The Tang and Song dynasties       did not undertake any significant effort in the region. Non-Han dynasties also built       their border walls: the Xianbei-ruled Northern Wei, the Khitan-ruled Liao, Jurchen Jin      and the Tangut-established Western Xia, who ruled vast territories over Northern China        throughout centuries, all constructed defensive walls but those were located much to the       north of the other Great Walls as we know it, within China's province of Inner Mongolia        and in Mongolia itself.

            A formal definition of what constitutes a "Great Wall" has not been agreed upon, making the full course of the Great Wall difficult to describe in its entirety. The defensive lines contain multiple stretches of ramparts, trenches and ditches, as well as individual fortresses.<br>
            In 2012, based on existing research and the results of a comprehensive mapping survey, the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China concluded that the remaining Great Wall associated sites include 10,051 wall sections, 1,764 ramparts or trenches, 29,510 individual buildings, and 2,211 fortifications or passes, with the walls and trenches spanning a total length of 21,196 km (13,171 mi). Incorporating advanced technologies, the study has concluded that the Ming Great Wall measure 8,850 km (5,500 mi). This consists of 6,259 km (3,889 mi) of wall sections, 359 km (223 mi) of trenches and 2,232 km (1,387 mi) of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers.] In addition, Qin, Han and earlier Great Wall sites are 3,080 km (1,914 mi) long in total; Jin dynasty (1115–1234) border fortifications are 4,010 km (2,492 mi) in length; the remainder date back to Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Sui, Tang, the Five Dynasties, Song, Liao and Xixia. About half of the sites are located in Inner Mongolia (31%) and Hebei (19%).<br><br>
            <b>Han Great Wall</b><br>
            Han fortifications starts from Yumen Pass and Yang Pass, southwest of Dunhuang, in Gansu province. Ruins of the remotest Han border posts are found in Mamitu (t 馬迷途, s 马迷途, Mǎmítú, l "horses losing their way") near Yumen Pass.<br><br>
            <b>Ming Great Wall</b><br>
            The Jiayu Pass, located in Gansu province, is the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall. From Jiayu Pass the wall travels discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor and into the deserts of Ningxia, where it enters the western edge of the Yellow River loop at Yinchuan. Here the first major walls erected during the Ming dynasty cut through the Ordos Desert to the eastern edge of the Yellow River loop. There at Piantou Pass (t 偏頭關, s 偏头关, Piāntóuguān) in Xinzhou, Shanxi province, the Great Wall splits in two with the "Outer Great Wall" (t 外長城, s 外长城, Wài Chǎngchéng) extending along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province, and the "Inner Great Wall" (t 內長城, s 內长城, Nèi Chǎngchéng) running southeast from Piantou Pass for some 400 km (250 mi), passing through important passes like the Pingxing Pass and Yanmen Pass before joining the Outer Great Wall at Sihaiye (四海冶, Sìhǎiyě), in Beijing's Yanqing County.

            Before the use of bricks, the Great Wall was mainly built from rammed earth, stones, and wood. During the Ming, however, bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall, as were materials such as tiles, lime, and stone. The size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone, so construction quickened. Additionally, bricks could bear more weight and endure better than rammed earth. Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick, but is more difficult to use. Consequently, stones cut in rectangular shapes were used for the foundation, inner and outer brims, and gateways of the wall. Battlements line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall, with defensive gaps a little over 30 cm (12 in) tall, and about 23 cm (9.1 in) wide. From the parapets, guards could survey the surrounding land. Communication between the army units along the length of the Great Wall, including the ability to call reinforcements and warn garrisons of enemy movements, was of high importance. Signal towers were built upon hill tops or other high points along the wall for their visibility. Wooden gates could be used as a trap against those going through. Barracks, stables, and armories were built near the wall's inner surface.

            While portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads. Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to 50 renminbi. Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining. A 2012 report by the National Cultural Heritage Administration states that 22% of the Ming Great Wall has disappeared, while 1,961 km (1,219 mi) of wall have vanished. More than 60 km (37 mi) of the wall in Gansu province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from sandstorms. In some places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 5 m (16 ft 5 in) to less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Various square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared. Many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion. In 2014 a portion of the wall near the border of Liaoning and Hebei province was repaired with concrete. The work has been much criticized.
